        <p>Slowly getting the hang of this but I would have thought
            that this body portion would be under the header.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe this will be something we could get clarity on ......wait a minute
            the page is moving down the more I type.
        </p>
        <p>Interesting.  If I am understanding this properly if I where to use only the 
            header, it would not include this portion of the page or the bottom images
            but since I have imported all three onto this page, that is why they are all 
            displayed.
